                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is David, and I am a third year undergraduate student studying Computational Media at Georgia Tech with a concentration in Media and Interaction Design.</p>
                <p>I started out as a Computer Science major, and switched to Computational Media in my second year because I realized that I am more interested in front-end development and design.</p>
