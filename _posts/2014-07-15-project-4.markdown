description: This project was for an introduction to computational media course, instructed by Ian Bogost, where we were assigned projects bi weekly based on a new programming language, framework, or API. One of the projects was to create a Twitter bot using NodeJS. For my Twitter bot, I created a bot that polls Donald Trump's tweets, creates a score for the tweet (based on words/characters like fake, lie, crooked, etc.), and gives the tweet a rating based on a scale of how an egg can be cooked.</br></br>The tools I used to create this were NodeJS, the Twitter API, and Adobe Illustrator for the egg illustrations.
