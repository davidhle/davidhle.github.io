description: I attended my first hackathon in the first weekend of March with three of my friends who also hadn't been to one, and we built a web application called Alpaca Bag. This is a travel board application inspired by those posters where you scratch off countries you've visited. </br></br> Built with D3.js, HTML, CSS, jQuery, ajax, and Javascript, the app lets you mark countries you have visited to, and on countries you have yet to select, then an image from Flickr appears in a tooltip while telling the user to "Pack their bags!" The user is then able to save their map as a png to save for printing, or to share with their friends.</br></br> Try out <a href="http://alpacabag.net" target="_blank">AlpacaBag</a>!
