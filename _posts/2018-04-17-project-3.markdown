description: In my principles of visual design, a poster campaign project was assigned where someone else and I would create a campaign about anything. My partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbdomingo/">Beatrice</a> and I decided we wanted to mock up a campaign for the glasses company, Warby Parker, but marketed towards college students, specifically Georgia Tech students. The posters above are the ones I created, and you can view the entire set of posters <a href="/pdf/Domingo_Le_Poster_Campaign.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>!
