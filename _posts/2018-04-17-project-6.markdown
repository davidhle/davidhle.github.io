description: Last fall, I joined the Technique, Georgia Tech's student-run newspaper as a graphic designer. At the time, I had recently switched my major to Computational Media, and wanted to join an organization that could hone my skills in design.</br></br>In my first semester on staff, I was assigned small assignments to make advertisements or small graphics that go along with articles. Now, as assistant design editor, I do those same things, while also writing editorial pieces every now and then!</br></br>The work shown here is a fake advertisement I created for our April Fool's special edition, where I created an ad for a student hotel on campus, when in reality, the building is where a lot of students have lecture and study.</br></br>I am currently in the process of putting my work on my <a href="https://www.behance.net/davidhle0f49">Behance profile</a>, so feel free to check out what I have so far (along with other projects I have done), and the my <a href="http://nique.net/author/david-le/">editorial pieces</a> I have written!
